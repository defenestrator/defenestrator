### Hi there 👋

✨ _Jeremy Jacob Anderson_ ✨ can be found here
- 🤔 Trying to talk sense, generally
  - I am informed that I have to make money or I guess everyone will just let me die?
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now.
- 🥦 Working at [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
- 🕴️ Senior DevOps Architect, I guess? (Some word salad largely devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition.)

- ⛈️ Ask me about Clouds, Distributed Computing, DevOps, AWS, Terraform, Svelte, Laravel, JavaScript, fly fishing, reptiles, or music
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003.
