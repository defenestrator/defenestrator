### Hi there 👋

I am ✨ _Jeremy Jacob Anderson_ ✨ usually of Boise Idaho, or thereabouts
- 🤔 Trying to talk sense, generally
  - I am informed that I have to make money or everyone will just let me die
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now
- 🥦 Working at [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
  - 🕴️ Senior Something Fancy Architectinator
    - Job titles tend to be word salad as devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition.
- ⛈️ If you really need to chat me up, for some reason, I'm a sucker for clouds, rivers and hydrology more generally, distributed computing, _DevOps_ whatever that is, _AWS_ whatever that is, _Terraform_ whatever HCL is, _Svelte_ whatever that is, _Laravel_ which isn't even a real word, fly fishing, reptiles (especially snakes, all the snakes), and music
  - I'm interested in everything as a matter of personal policy, don't abuse me; or do, but make it sexy
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003
