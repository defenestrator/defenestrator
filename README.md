### Hi there 👋

✨ _Jeremy Jacob Anderson_ ✨ can be found here
- 🤔 Trying to talk sense, generally
  - I am informed that I have to make money or I guess everyone will just let me die?
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now.
- 🥦 Working at [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
- 🕴️ Senior DevOps Architect?
  - Job titles tend to be word salad as devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition.
- ⛈️ if you really need to chat me up, I'm a sucker for clouds and hydrology more generally, distributed computing, _DevOps_ whatever that is, AWS, Terraform, Svelte, Laravel, fly fishing, reptiles (especially snakes, all the snakes), and music.
  - I'm interested in everything as a matter of personal policy, don't abuse me; or do, but make it sexy.
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003.
