### Hi there 👋

I am ✨ _Jeremy Jacob Anderson_ ✨ usually of Boise, Idaho, or thereabouts
- 🤔 Trying to talk sense, generally
  - I am informed that I have to make money or everyone will just let me die
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now
- 🥦 Left [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) after two years kicking butt in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
  - 🕴️ Senior Something Fancy Architectinator
    - Job titles in tech are often as devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition.
- ⛈️ If you want to chat me up for some reason, I'm a sucker for clouds (and hydrology, generally):
  - Distributed computing solutions design and cloud-native application engineering specialist
  - _DevOps_, whatever that is
  - _AWS_, whatever that is
  - _Terraform_, whatever HCL is
  - _Svelte_, whatever that is
  - _Laravel_, which isn't even a real word
  - Learning Go, finally, again, and really liking it.
- I love fly fishing, reptiles, and music
- I'm interested in everything, as a matter of personal policy
  - don't abuse me; or do, but make it sexy
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003
