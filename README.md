### Hi there! 👋 *I'm real good at computers and I need a job.* 
#### (11/2023)

I am ✨ _Jeremy Jacob Anderson_ ✨ usually of Boise, Idaho, or thereabouts
- Out here in meatworld 🤔 trying to talk sense
  - I am informed that I have to make money or everyone will just let me die
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now
- Separated from [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) 🥦 after two years kicking butt in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
  - 🕴️ Senior Something Fancy Architectinator
    - Job titles in tech are often as devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition
- ⛈️ If you want to chat me up for some reason, I'm a sucker for clouds (and hydrology, generally):
  - Specialist in cloud-native application design
  - _DevOps_, whatever that is
  - _AWS_, whatever that is
  - _Terraform_, whatever HCL is
  - _Svelte_ is compelling, so is _HTMX_.
    - React and TS are misunderstood and not that great
  - _Laravel_, which isn't even a real word, is still a good framework
    - All frameworks are cargo cults. Yes, even the ones that **I** like and your favorites, like Spring Boot or whatever
      - We should maintain wary mindfulness of that fact when making technology decisions
  - Learning Go. The programming language, not the board game.
- I love fly fishing, reptiles, and music
- I'm interested in everything, as a matter of personal policy
  - don't abuse me; or do, but make it sexy
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003
