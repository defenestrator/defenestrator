Howdy, I'm **Jeremy Jacob Anderson** usually of Boise, Idaho, or thereabouts
- Out here in meatworld trying to talk sense
  - I am informed that I have to make money or everyone will just let me die
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now
- Separated from [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) after two years kicking butt in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
  - Senior Something Fancy Architectinator
    - Job titles in tech are often as devoid of meaning as iceberg lettuce is of nutrition

  - _Svelte_ is compelling, so is _HTMX_.
    - React and TypeScript are misunderstood and not really all that great
  - _Laravel_, which isn't even a real word, is still a good framework
    - All frameworks are cargo cults. Yes, even the ones that **I** like, and your favorites like Spring Boot or whatever
      - We should maintain wary mindfulness of that fact when making technology decisions
  - Learning Go. The programming language, not the board game.
