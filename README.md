Howdy, I'm **Jeremy Jacob Anderson** usually of Boise, Idaho, or thereabouts
- Out here in meatworld trying to talk sense
  - I am informed that I have to make money or everyone will just let me die
    - Seems a bit harsh, but I'll play along for now
- Separated from [Sparq](https://teamsparq.com) after two years kicking butt in _Cloud_, _DevOps_, _Web_ and _Big Data_
  - Job titles in tech are devoid of meaning, too often.
- Co-founder and engineering 👑 at [EDOS](https://edos.io)
- ⛈️ I love all of the clouds (and hydrology, generally)
- Cloud-native application architecture specialist
  - _DevOps_, whatever that is
  - _AWS_, whatever that is
  - _[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)_, whatever HCL is
  - [Snowflake Data Cloud](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) ❄️
  - [Turso](https://turso.tech/)
    -   Be an edgelord, get that **µsecond** latency
  - _[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)_ is compelling, so is _[htmx](https://htmx.org/)_.
    - React and TypeScript are a mess, let's talk about that.
  - _[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)_, which isn't even a real word, is still a good framework
    - All frameworks are cargo cults
    -   Yes, even the ones that **I** like, and your favorites like Spring Boot or whatever
      - We should maintain wary mindfulness of that fact when making technology decisions
  - Learning Go. The programming language, not the board game.
- I love fly fishing, reptiles, and music
- I'm interested in everything, as a matter of personal policy
  - don't abuse me; but if you do, at least make it funny
- 💻 Coding for fun since 1983
- 💸 Coding for money since 2003
